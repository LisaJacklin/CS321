	pthread_create(&t1,NULL,aFunction,NULL);//a thread is created
	sleep(2);
	pthread_create(&t2,NULL,aFunction,NULL);//another thread is created after 2 seconds of the first one
	pthread_join(t1,NULL);//These joins will ensure that each thread is waiting until all threads complete
	pthread_join(t2,NULL);

}


/*
 * 2 threads are being created, one 2 seconds after the first one.
But the first thread will sleep for 4 seconds after acquiring the lock.
Thus the second thread will not enter immediately after it is called, it will enter 4 â€“ 2 = 2 secs after it is called.*/

//Try commenting out the semaphore part. sem_wait(&mutex); and sem_post(&mutex);Then, observe the sequence of the print msg. You will see that both the threads enter the critical section simultaneously.
