CS 31 OS ch 11 DiskManagement Lab Notes

- only those with root or sudo permissions can add a user
 -for every user there is a home directory

-command sw [name] is used to change between users within a single terminal so long as the correct password is given. This means we are in the new home directory
-command pwd will give the current directory you are in

-setting up a group of users ; generally done to make it easier for admins and larger organizations to fix issues and permissions.
