#1: I used the chmod command to change the permission of the user, group, and others
#first, since we want to give the user full permissions in binary that is 111 == 7 
# and since we only want to give rx to others and groups, 011 == 3 is used in the
#rest of the command.
#note that I used filename inplace of an actual file

chmod 733 filename

#2:next three different instructions were used to set up FAT, NTFS, and EXT3 filesystem.
#these were mounted inside /mnt/ as myFat, myNTFS and myEXT3 respectively.

#custom directory for unique subdirectories within /mnt/
mkdir /mnt/myFat
mkdir /mnt/myNTFS
mkdir /mnt/myEXT3

#creating the file systems
dd if = /dev/zero of=fat-image.dd bs=1M count = 10 
dd if = /dev/zero of=ntfs-image.dd bs=1M count = 10
dd if = /dev/zero of=ntfs-image.dd bs=1M count = 10;

#initializing the filesystems with the .dd created
mkfs.fat fat-image.dd
mkfs.ntfs ntfs-image.dd
mkfs.ext3 ext3-image.dd

#then to mount the images
mount fat-image.dd   /mnt/myFat
mount ntfs-image.dd  /mnt/myNTFS
mount ext3-image.dd  /mnt/myEXT3

#3: now that the file systems are created we can use df to check that each has been created correctly.

df

#when using this command, you can see that these three file systems have the same values 
#since I set them to be such, and there is a lot of open space (in my case).

#4: to create users on a Linux system named testuser1, testuser2, and testuser3, the 
#following command was used:

adduser testuser1
adduser testuser2
adduser testuser3

#5: then a group was created called myfsuser

groupadd myfsuser

#6:now that a group myfsuser has been created, its time to add all three of the test users

usermod -a -G myfsuser testuser1
usermod -a -G myfsuser testuser2
usermod -a -G myfsuser testuser3

#7:since we are already within this group, we should be able to simply change the 
#access this group has to the myFAT directory

chmod 070 myFAT #note the zeros means no permissions unless part of the group
